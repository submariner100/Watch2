# Watch2
rock - paper - scissors game for the iWatch
Lesson learnt - Using WatchOS3 - In this lesson the basic layout of the app was set up. This layout looks exactly the same on an 38mm
or 42mm watch as proportional layout was used. Images were added, groups, labels, timer and seperator bar. All the IBOutlets and
IBActions were added.
